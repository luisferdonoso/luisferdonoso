As a Junior Data Engineer and Cloud Engineer based in Berlin, I specialize in developing innovative no-code and low-code database solutions within the finance sector, alongside crafting algorithms for automating credit evaluation controls. Currently enhancing my expertise with a Master's in Data Science, I've embarked on data engineering projects utilizing Docker, Terraform, and Apache Airflow for data pipeline creation and cloud infrastructure modeling. My professional experience includes roles as a Junior IT Analyst, where I've excelled in process automation, data analysis, and cross-functional collaboration to meet complex IT needs. My skill set spans Python, Git, Bash, and cloud technologies (AWS, GCP), underpinned by a solid foundation in containers, big data, and data governance 🦾
